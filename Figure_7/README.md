Caption: Free energy estimation of AT1 receptor under various conditions: a) apo in SOPC, b) AngII-bound in SOPC, c) S1I8-bound in SOPC, d) apo in SOPC with 10 mN/m tension, e) apo in SOPC:SOPE, and f) apo in POPC. Free energy estimated with LDT multiple-walker well-tempered metadynamics and plotted as two dimensional surfaces through histogram re-weighting using the TM1-TM6, TM6-H8, TM1-ICL2, and TM5-ICL2 distances (see Methods). Energy scale shown on top left with lowest values shown in dark blue and highest values shown in yellow (> 7 kcal/mol). Isocontour lines shown in cyan color drawn in 1 kcal/mol intervals. Grey markers show distance values from the inactive state crystal structure with receptor bound to a selective antagonist (PDBID: 4YAY) and orange markers show distance values from the active state crystal structure with bound AngII (PDBID: 6OS0).

*This folder contains the input data generated from the MD simulations, the python script used to generate the corresponding plot, and the final png image. Each data file has a header that describes each column in the file. Some labels added to png image manually after generation with the python script.*

*Statistical analyses including mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc. calculated within the python scripts based on the input data files.*
