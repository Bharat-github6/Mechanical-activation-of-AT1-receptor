Caption: Alpha-helicity of ICL2 for selected Anton 2 simulations with the CHARMM36 FF. Dashed grey and orange lines show values from crystal structures of the inactive receptor bound to a selective antagonist (4YAY) and active receptor bound to AngII (6OS0) respectively.

*This folder contains the input data generated from the MD simulations, the python script used to generate the corresponding plot, and the final png image. Each data file has a header that describes each column in the file.*

*Statistical analyses including mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc. calculated within the python scripts based on the input data files.*
