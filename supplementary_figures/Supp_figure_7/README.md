Caption: Time evolution of double mutant F309P/313P AT1 receptor (apo) simulations in various membranes for replica 1. Panels a-f show the average intra-protein distances between TM1-TM6, TM1-ICL2, TM5-ICL2, TM6-H8, and TM3-TM6 as well as the alpha-helicity of ICL2 respectively. Data for SOPC shown in blue, SOPC with 10 mN/m tension in grey, POPC in green, and SOPC:SOPE in red. Rectangular boxes on the right of each panel show box and whiskers plots including median, quartiles, and extrema of the two replicas of each system over the last 500 ns (n=2 independent simulations, 200,000 time points analyzed). Dashed grey and orange lines show values from crystal structures of the inactive receptor bound to a selective antagonist (4YAY) and active receptor bound to AngII (6OS0) respectively.

*This folder contains the input data generated from the MD simulations, the python script used to generate the corresponding plot, and the final png image. Each data file has a header that describes each column in the file.*

*Statistical analyses including mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc. calculated within the python scripts based on the input data files.*
