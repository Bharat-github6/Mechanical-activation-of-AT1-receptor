Caption: Stability of the AT1 receptor in POPC membranes under tension (5 and 10 mN/m) starting from an active configuration. Panels a-f show the average intra-protein distances between TM1-TM6, TM1-ICL2, TM5-ICL2, TM6-H8, and TM3-TM6 as well as the alpha-helicity of ICL2 respectively. Data for SOPC without tension shown for comparison. Dashed grey and orange lines show values from crystal structures of the inactive receptor bound to a selective antagonist (4YAY) and active receptor bound to AngII (6OS0) respectively. Data taken from a single simulation.
