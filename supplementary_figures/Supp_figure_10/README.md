Caption: Depth of insertion of H8 relative to the average position of the glycerol phosphate atoms on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Data shown for the apo WT (dashed lines) and apo double-mutant F309P/313P (solid lines) AT1 receptor in SOPC (a), SOPC with 10 mN/m tension (b), POPC (c), and SOPC:SOPE (d). Data from each replica shown in different colors. Negative values indicate movement of H8 into the hydrocarbon core, while positive values indicate movement toward the water interface.
