Caption: Time evolution of the TM1-TM6 distance in the AT1 receptor in SOPC and POPC membrane simulations using the CHARMM36 forcefield. a) Apo AT1 receptor in SOPC and POPC. b) AT1 receptor in SOPC bound to angiotensin II and apo AT1 receptor in SOPC with a membrane tension of 15 mN/m. Dashed grey and orange lines show values from crystal structures of the inactive receptor bound to a selective antagonist (4YAY) and active receptor bound to AngII (6OS0) respectively.
